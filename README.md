### 🚀 About Me

I am a 2nd-year student at **Izmir Katip Celebi University**. I started with software development but realized that controlling hardware is what I really enjoy.

I switched to **Pop!_OS (Linux)** recently because I want to get comfortable with the command line and understand how systems work under the hood. I prefer building my own tools rather than relying on ready-made solutions whenever I can.

* 🌱 **Currently Learning:** I am fully focused on **STM32 development** and improving my **C programming** skills for embedded systems.
* 🎯 **Future Goal:** My aim is to specialize in **Embedded Systems** (specifically STM32 architecture) and work in the **Defense Industry**.
